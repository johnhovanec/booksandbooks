# booksandbooks

### A fictitious bookstore e-commerce application built as an individual project for COSC617, Advanced Web Development, at Towson University in the fall of 2016.

#### This project was a great testbed for experimenting with AngularJS, MongoDB, jQuery, Pug, and Bootstrap. Thanks to [sahat/hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) which we used to get our projects up and running.
